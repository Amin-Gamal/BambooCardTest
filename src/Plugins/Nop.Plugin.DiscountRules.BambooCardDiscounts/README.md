## Discount Plugin - Nop.Plugin.DiscountRules.BambooCardDiscounts
Once the BambooCardDiscounts plugin is installed, a new discount is automatically
created with the default name “BambooCard Discount” and a default percentage value
of 10%.
You can access the BambooCardDiscounts settings page from the side menu in the admin
panel to configure the discount options.

A discount requirement rule is also added to the newly created discount. You can
configure the number of previous orders a customer must have placed in order for the
discount to be applied.

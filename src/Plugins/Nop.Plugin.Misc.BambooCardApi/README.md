## Gift Message plugin - Nop.Plugin.Widgets.CheckoutGiftMessage

When the CheckoutGiftMessage plugin is installed, a new checkout attribute is created
with the name “CheckoutGiftMessage”, which adds a multiline textbox in the checkout
process. This allows customers to leave a gift message if desired.
The textbox appears just before the Confirm Order step.
